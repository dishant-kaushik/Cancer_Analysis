# Cancer Analysis
  
## Project Overview
This project predicts whether a patient's cancer is malignant or benign based on input features. The analysis is performed using machine learning techniques in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
- Prediction of cancer malignancy

## Installation
To run this project, install the required dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Open the `Cancer_Analysis.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colaboratory.
2. Run all cells sequentially to preprocess data, train the model, and make predictions.
3. Modify and experiment with different models as needed.

## Dataset
- The dataset used for this analysis contains features relevant to cancer diagnosis.
- If required, download and place the dataset in the appropriate directory.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib (if visualization is included)
